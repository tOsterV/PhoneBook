A simple sketch of a phone book in Java is presented. Commands represented by the program:
1) View all contacts in the phonebook. 
2) Viewing information by phone number. 
3) Change contact information.(renaming by number). 
4) Adding a new contact in the form: number:name. 
5) Deleting a contact. 
6) Exit from the program. 
7) Help - help with commands and complete information. 

What's new in the latest version of the app:
1) Was Hashmap --> became List+object. 
2) There was a monolithic structure of the work --> became distributed by classes and, accordingly, by Java files. 
3) There was direct access to contacts --> began to work according to the principles of OOP, i.e. encapsulation, polymorphism.
4) There was a direct search for contact --> became linear search. 

Changes on 31.10.25:
1) Add logic of SIM-cards.
2) Add new class (PhoneDataBase).
